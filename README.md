# Hi,
My name is **Umesh Chandra Dani** currently a student.

The purpose of this project is to complete an assignment given by Techwondoe. Right now, the project have only one page i.e user setting page. 

User Setting Page Description:
  - User can see the list of users in a tabular format.
  - Table have the following columns:
    - Name, Email, Profile pic
    - Status
    - Role
    - Last Login Date
  - User can also create, delete and edit the users.
  - Create, Edit and Delete functions will effect only on client side.
  - On Delete user will be taken to confirmation modal.
  - Create and Edit forms will also be inside modal.
  - User can also download the users data in CSV format


## Available Scripts

By using the following scripts user can interact with projects

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
